## Hypothesis Testing

The following is a well-established research pipeline: 
1. Define a research question, or hypothesis
2. Design an appropriate study or trial to test that hypothesis
3. Conduct the study or trial
4. Observe, collate and process the results (data)
5. Measure the agreement with the hypothesis
6. Draw conclusions regarding the hypothesis

In this model, the hypothesis should be clearly defined and testable. In 
hypothesis testing, this means that our question has just two possible answers: 
a ”null hypothesis” (H<sub>0</sub>), which is a specific statement that we are looking to
disprove with our data, and an “alternative hypothesis” (H<sub>1</sub>), which is a 
statement opposing H<sub>0</sub> and which we will only accept if the data and analysis is 
sufficiently convincing.

When carrying out hypothesis testing, we normally use a standard framework.
1. We establish our null and alternative hypothesis
2. We collect data, often by measurement or experimentation on a small sample 
group representative of the whole populations
3. From the data, we calculate a test statistic – an estimation of a population 
parameter derived from the data – and a rejection region – a range of values for
the test statistic for which we would reject H<sub>0</sub> and accept H<sub>1</sub>
4. If the test statistic falls within the rejection region and we accept H<sub>1</sub>, we 
can calculate a P-value, the probability of the observed test statistic (or one 
more favourable to H<sub>1</sub>) occurring if H<sub>0</sub> were true.

Hypothesis testing is often used in inferential statistics, where measurements 
are taken on a random sample from a large population in order to estimate (or 
infer) something about that population as a whole. Example of inferential 
statistics include opinion polls and drug trials.

## P-values and rejection of the null hypothesis
* The null hypothesis is tested against the alternative one using a 
distribution of a statistic
* The P-value is the probability of making a mistake by rejecting H<sub>0</sub> even
if it is true
* The probability of rejecting H<sub>0</sub>, given the truth of H<sub>0</sub>, is called the 
significance level, denoted α (often α=0.05, but as low as α=0.0000003 in
some disciplines)
* If the P-value < 0.05, we are 95% confident when we reject H<sub>0</sub> 
  + Conclusion: we can reject H<sub>0</sub>

## Confidence intervals
A confidence interval gives more information than the results of a
hypothesis test (reject or don’t reject): it provides a range of
plausible values for the parameter being studied.
Example: If the sample mean is used to estimate the population mean, the
confidence interval gives the upper and lower bounds of a range in which
we have 95% confidence that the real population mean occurs.


> ## Challenge 3
> What conclusion can you make if your analysis gives a p-value of 0.994?
> 1. You can accept the alternative hypothesis with high confidence
> 2. You can accept the alternative hypothesis with low confidence
> 3. You should reject the alternative hypothesis
> 4. You can neither accept nor reject the alternative hypothesis
> > ## Solution to challenge 3
> > 
> > Option 3. If the p-value is above our chosen significance level (commonly 0.05, 0.01 or 0.001) we reject the alternative hypothesis

## Testing errors
In hypothesis testing, there are two possible causes for a false 
conclusion: rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (a type I 
error), or failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false (a type
II error). The probability of a type 1 error is given by the P-value; it
is possible to calculate the probability of a type II error, but we will 
not cover that in this course.
