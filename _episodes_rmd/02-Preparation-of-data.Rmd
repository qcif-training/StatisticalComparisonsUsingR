## Previewing data

Prior to uploading any dataset into R for analysis, it is useful to review the 
contents of that file to understand the structure of the data. This will allow
you to choose the best data structure for your dataset, and will identify the 
relevant command and settings you need when uploading the data to R. 

For small files, like the one we are using today, this review can be done with a
simple text editor, either an app on your computer or from within RStudio. For 
very large datasets this is not advisable - files may take a very long time to 
open and may even crash your computer. Such large files may have documentation 
explaining their format, or you may need to use the `head` function to look at 
just the first part of the file.

Today we will be working with a datafile based on a study into the effects of
treatment with the drug ursodeoxycholic acid on gallstones. This is based on a 
real study ([Hood et al, 1993](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1375471/)).
In this study, detailed follow-up records were kept for 93 patients receiving
various combinations of dietary intervention and ursodeoxycholic acid treatment
to investigate ways of reducing the risk of gallstone recurrence. For our
exercises today we will just use a subset of the data, with dummy demographic
data substituted for real patient information.

> ## Challenge 1
> 
> Use RStudio “Files” window, your text editor of choice, or a spreadsheet 
> program to open and review the data file _gallstones.csv_ (do not overwrite 
> the file by saving afterwards). Consider the meaning of the headers and what
> the nature of the data in each column might be; perhaps discuss with your 
> neighbour if you are in an in-person session. How many patient records are 
> there in the dataset?
> > ## Solution to challenge 1
> > 
> > The field contents are as follows:
> > * Patient_ID – a unique numerical identifier for each patient
> > * Gender – female or male: one-letter character string
> > * Age – patient’s age: numerical value in years
> > * Height – patient’s height: numerical value in (probably) cm
> > * Weight – patient’s weight: numerical value in (probably) kg
> > * BMI – patient’s body mass index (weight/height in m<sup>2</sup>)
> > * Obese – is the patient obese (BMI>30): 0=no, 1=yes;
> > * Smoking.Status – does the patient smoke: 1=non-smoker, 2=smoker; 
> > * Alcohol.Consumption – does the patient drink alcohol: 0=no, 1=previously,
> > 2=currently; 
> > * Treatment – did the patient receive the ursodeoxycholic acid treatment: 
> > 0=untreated, 1=treated; 
> > * Rec – did gallstones recur: 0=no recurrence, 1=recurrence; 
> > * Mult – did the patient have multiple gallstones: 0=single stone, 1=multiple 
> > stones; 
> > * Diam – original gallstone diameter in mm; 
> > * Dis – time in months for gallstone dissolution
> > 
> > There are a total of 37 patient records in this file

## Importing data

Once you've reviewed the contents of the data file, you can decide how best to
upload it into R. In this case, we have a tabular layout with fields separated
by commas - a CSV file - so we will use the `read.csv` function to import this
dataset.

> ## Tip
> When reading in tabular data in R, you can use either `read.table` or a range
> of pre-configured aliases: `read.csv`, `read.csv2`, `read.delim` and
> `read.delim2`. These have function arguments already set to correspond to a
> range of different formats of CSV (comma separated value) and TSV (tab
> separated value) files.
{: .callout}

```{r}
# The default settings of `read.csv` differ between R versions, so when running
# the command, we need to specify the stringsAsFactors parameter
gallstones <- read.csv("data/gallstones.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Now the file is uploaded, you can find out more about this dataset using the `str`
and `summary` functions.
```{r}
str(gallstones)
summary(gallstones)
```

## Columns as factors

This shows, among other details, that the dataset consists of records from 37 
patients, aged 31 to 90, of whom 21 are female and 16 male. Looking further, you
may notice that patient identifier, which should be unique, has been imported 
as a factor - this is probably not the best option for a unique identifier so it 
would be best to convert this to character strings.

```{r}
gallstones$Patient_ID <- as.character(gallstones$Patient_ID)
str(gallstones$Patient_ID)
```
> ## Tip
> Sometimes patient ID is numeric and ordered according to recruitment. In this
> situation, it can be used as a surrogate for time to check for any biases over 
> the course of the study.
{: .callout}

> ## Challenge 2
> 
> How could you have modified your `read.csv` command so that patient identifiers
> were imported as character strings in the first place? What other issues might
> this have caused?
> > ## Solution to challenge 2
> > 
> > You could use the `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` argument to `read.csv`. But this
> > would mean that Gender was also read in as character strings, and that is best
> > represented as a factor.
